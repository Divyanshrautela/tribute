Ratan Naval Tata, born on December 28, 1937, in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, is an iconic figure in the
global business landscape and a revered philanthropist. He is best known for his tenure as the Chairman of
Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, one of India’s largest and most respected conglomerates.

Ratan Tata was educated at Cornell University, where he earned a degree in architecture and structural
engineering. He later completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School, equipping him
with a solid foundation for his future leadership roles. In 1962, he joined the Tata Group, working his way
up through various roles, which provided him with a deep understanding of the organization’s diverse
operations.

In 1991, Ratan Tata took over as Chairman of Tata Sons, succeeding his uncle, J.R.D. Tata. Under his
leadership, the Tata Group transformed into a global enterprise, with revenues growing over 40 times and
profits soaring by over 50 times.


Ratan Tata spearheaded key acquisitions, including Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, which significantly
expanded Tata Group’s global footprint.

Beyond his business acumen, Ratan Tata is celebrated for his commitment to ethical leadership and
philanthropy. He firmly believed in the principle of giving back to society, a legacy inherited from the
Tata family. His contributions have had a profound impact on India’s development, particularly in the fields
of education, healthcare, and rural development. The Tata Trusts, which he continues to guide, donate a
substantial portion of their income to charitable causes.

In 2008, Ratan Tata unveiled the Tata Nano, the world’s most affordable car, which was a testament to his
vision of making car ownership accessible to millions in India. Although the Nano didn’t achieve commercial
success, it underscored his commitment to innovation and his desire to improve the lives of ordinary people.

Ratan Tata stepped down as Chairman of Tata Sons in 2012 but continues to inspire as Chairman Emeritus. 
His contributions to business and society have earned him numerous accolades, including the Padma Vibhushan and
Padma Bhushan, two of India’s highest civilian honors. Ratan Tata’s legacy is one of visionary leadership,
compassion, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of society.</pre></p>
